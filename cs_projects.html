            <h1>Pantry App "Kämmmerchen" </h1> 2022
            <p>In this project, I developed an Android application using Android Studio and 
              Java with the primary goal of creating an efficient solution for tracking products 
              in my fridge and pantry.<br><br>
              The app utilizes barcode scanning capabilities to empower users to seamlessly scan 
              product barcodes. However, it's important to note that barcodes themselves do not 
              contain information like expiration dates or product names.<br>
              The key functionality of the app lies in allowing users to manually enter essential 
              product information such as name, expiration date, and quantity after scanning a product. 
              Notably, if a product has been scanned before, the app intelligently autofills the name, 
              streamlining the data entry process and enhancing user convenience.
              The collected data is managed and stored using Firebase, a cloud-based database that ensures 
              real-time updates and synchronization across devices. <br>
              Additionally, the app includes an expiration date alert system, visually highlighting 
              products that have reached their expiration date in red. This serves as a valuable reminder 
              for users to manage their inventory effectively, particularly for perishable items. Users 
              also have the flexibility to edit details of previously added products, providing them with 
              control over their stored data.

          <h1>Sudoku App</h1> 2020
          <p>Developed a dedicated Sudoku application using Android Studio 
            with the focus of replicating the traditional pen-and-paper Sudoku experience.<br><br>
            This app was created in response to dissatisfaction with existing applications, 
            which often incorporated distracting features that simplified the problem solving. 
            The goal was to offer users an authentic and 
            immersive puzzle-solving experience in a digital format. Unlike many Sudoku apps,
            this project intentionally avoids automatic highlighting or assistance features, 
            preserving the purity of the solving process. <br>
            The application was developed using Android Studio. 
            The app's functionality and logic were implemented using Java.

            <h1>Sudoku Pygame</h1> 2019
            <p>Development of a fully playable Sudoku game using Pygame, integrating a Python 
              algorithm for generating Sudoku grids based on backtracking principles. <br> <br>
              This project offers a user-friendly interface allowing players to engage with randomly 
              generated Sudoku puzzles. A graphical user interface (GUI) built with Pygame provides 
              an intuitive and visually appealing platform for players to interact with Sudoku puzzles.
              This project highlights my proficiency in game development, Pygame, and the successful 
              integration of algorithmic solutions into real-world applications.</p>

          <h1>Random Sudoku Generator</h1>2019
          
          <p>Development of a Python algorithm for generating fully filled Sudoku grids.<br><br> 
            
            The project was implemented in Python. The main task was to design an algorithm 
            that provides both random and complete solutions for Sudoku puzzles. 
            The use of backtracking ensured that every generated puzzle has a valid solution.
            Randomness was achieved through random number selection.<br>
            The finished grids can can serve as a starting point for creating Sudoku challenges.
            This project highlights my ability to tackle algorithmic challenges and solve complex problems in Python.
